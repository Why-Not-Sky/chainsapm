opensource-clrprofiler
======================

This project is an attempt to bring some opensourcness to the .NET profiling world. [Scott Hackett](mailto:code@scotthackett.com) provided the idea for the use of ATL boiler plate code with his [article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15410/Creating-a-Custom-NET-Profiler) at CodeProect. The code I am using references a lot of resources. If you browse the Wiki you will find the major ones.

Feel free to branch and ask to contribute. The project is a bit adventurous but it will be great fun and a good learning experience for all.
